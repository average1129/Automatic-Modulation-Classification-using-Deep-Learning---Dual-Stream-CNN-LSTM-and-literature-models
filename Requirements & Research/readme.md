#Requirements

##Introduction 

*	Despite regulations by governments and regulating authorities, the signal space is a very noisy environment.

*	A large number of applications require identification and monitoring of all these signals, both for civilian and military applications. 

*	The next evolution in wireless communications systems is the development of cognitive radio, Dynamic Spectrum Access is a fundamental part of Cognitive Radio. For this transceiver should be able to gather information about its information 

*	There is a need to know what kind of signals are being transmitted at any given point in time 

*	Modulation Recognition is the task of classifying the modulation type of a received radio signal

##Research 

*	In the past, manual modulation recognition was implemented based on a number of measured parameters to provide a classification of different emitters using either decision theoretic or probability based methods

*	“Convolutional Radio Modulation Recognition Networks” published in 2016 introduced the idea of using Deep Learning networks for Automatic Modulation Classification.

*There are now a large variety of deep architectures that have been developed for the purpose of Modulation Recognition.
