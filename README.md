## Workflow Planning 

This Project would not use a traditional waterfall methodology for implementation. We would choose to implement Agile methodology instead. The reason for this decision are: 

* A large number of different deep architectures have been implemented in this research domain with the same dataset.
* Models build off each other in increasing complexity, and with experience gained in the team. 
* This is a very recent field of research and papers are routinely published in this domain, this will give us the flexibility to keep track with new developments and implement them in our project
* We can narrow our research to a model type that offers promising results after a breadthfirst implementation of models  that have been used before 

Using Agile methodology will give us more flexibility in developing the project after a common code base for data processing has been established.
